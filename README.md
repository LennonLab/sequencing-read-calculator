# sequencing-read-calculator
Claculates the number of sequening reads required for the minimal coverage to be higher than some value

Scenario: resequencing an evolved population (single species) to charecterize diversity. 

The following code calculates the number of reads needed to insure that all the bases are sequenced by some minimal covrage.

Calculation is based on footnote #2 in Ilumina techical note "Estimating Sequencing Coverage"
